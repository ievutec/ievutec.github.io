Here's some relevant errata that don't yet have a home anywhere else:

## Science Writing

### UPDATE

As of February 2021 I am now also a student contributor to [Physics World](https://physicsworld.com/) on quantum developments in the scientific community :)

I've done quite a bit of science communication and outreach in my day, although sadly not as many of these endeavours have a traceable online presence (mostly talks at events and such). However, I did edit and contribute to the Edinburgh University Science magazine (EUSci):

I also recently peer reviewed an article for the [Cambridge Journal of Science & Policy](http://www.cuspe.org/category/publications-media/cambridge-journal-of-science-policy-allpublications/):

## Clubhouse

I am an admin on several science and tech-driven clubs on the ephemeral, recent social app [Clubhouse](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56180581) like [Science on the rocks](https://twitter.com/SciOTRocks). I organise panels and moderate rooms which host discussions on every topic from AI to Category Theory to Physics to Neuroscience.


## Interviews

I was back home for Christmas last year in Vilnius, Lithuania, when a cheery English hairdresser (whilst chopping away at my locks) told me he had a friend named [Goda RaibytÄ—](https://creativemornings.com/talks/goda-raibyte) who just happened to be a pretty prominent science journalist. She had apparently been interested in creating an episode on Quantum Information and we ended up getting in touch.

What followed was a series of exchanges, an interview on Zoom (the COVID lockdowns had recently all begun and we were in different countries at this point), a script I got to edit and curate and finally an invitation for a video interview to appear on the show. These are the fruits of our labour (note that the video is entirely in Lithuanian):

[Interview 1: Radikalus Smalsumas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpxF5os6peM&t=3s)

Of course what followed was a series of invitations to other science shows (I presume not too many Lithuanians are working in Quantum Information and have their names out in the public eye), so I ended up on two radio shows, both of which were a delight (again these are in Lithuanian so unsure if anyone finds this useful, but here we are):
