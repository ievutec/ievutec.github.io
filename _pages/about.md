I am a Quantum Computing enthusiast and a PhD candidate at the [Quantum Optics and Quantum Many-Body Systems](https://qoqms.phys.strath.ac.uk/) group at Strathclyde University, working on applications of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) as well as Counterdiabatic (CD) driving of many-body quantum states. 

I completed an Integrated MSc in Computational Physics at the University of Edinburgh in 2019, during which I worked with Elham Kashefi and the lovely team of the  [Edinburgh-Paris Virtual Quantum Lab](http://edi-par.com/). For my [Bachelor's thesis](http://ievutec.github.io/files/BSc.pdf) I simulated a Quantum Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme on the IBM 16 qubit chip and for my Master's I developed a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) method: the [Continuous Variable Born Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00904). 

Apart from my research I also enjoy contributing to [science communication](https://ievutec.github.io/portfolio/) through writing and editing articles, giving interviews and curating scripts as well as via a largely science-based [blog](https://toomuchtimecankillyou.com/). I'm an avid hillwalker in the scottish hills, a former debater
