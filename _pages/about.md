I am a Quantum Computing enthusiast and a PhD candidate at the [Quantum Optics and Quantum Many-Body Systems](https://qoqms.phys.strath.ac.uk/) group at Strathclyde working on applications of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) as well as Counterdiabatic (CD) driving of many-body quantum states. 

I completed an Integrated MSc in Computational Physics at the University of Edinburgh in 2019, during which I worked with Elham Kashefi and the lovely team of the  [Edinburgh-Paris Virtual Quantum Lab](http://edi-par.com/). For my Bachelor's thesis I simulated a Quantum Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme on the [IBM 16 qubit chip](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/) and for my Master's
