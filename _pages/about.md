I am a Quantum Computing enthusiast and a PhD candidate at the [Quantum Optics and Quantum Many-Body Systems](https://qoqms.phys.strath.ac.uk/) group at Strathclyde working on applications of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) as well as Counterdiabatic (CD) driving of many-body quantum states.
