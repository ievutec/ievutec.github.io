[LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImQeEs0BcQs&t=5304s) A talk for the annual PQI2020 poster session for the [Pittsburgh Quantum Institute](https://www.pqi.org/) presenting my poster about the [CVBM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00904)  (starts at 33:20).

## Slides

As few of my talks so far have actually been recorded (and so far all on one subject), here's some fun slides from some other presentations I've given:

* [Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Quantum Computers](http://ievutec.github.io/files/AWE_presentation.pdf) (_12 March, 2020_)
* [Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning](http://ievutec.github.io/files/IGSQT_pres.pdf) (_19 June, 2020_, presented for [IGSQT](https://igsqt.ac.uk/))
* [Variational Counterdiabatic Driving](http://ievutec.github.io/files/CD_Driving.pdf) (_12 November, 2020_, presented in a joint seminar with the University of Waterloo)
