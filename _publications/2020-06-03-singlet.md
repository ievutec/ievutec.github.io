Starting from weakly bound Feshbach molecules, we demonstrate a two-photon pathway to the dipolar ground state of bi-alkali molecules that involves only singlet-to-singlet optical transitions. This pathway eliminates the search for a suitable intermediate state with sufficient singlet-triplet mixing and the exploration of its hyperfine structure, as is typical for pathways starting from triplet dominated Feshbach molecules. By selecting a Feshbach state with a stretched singlet hyperfine component and controlling the laser polarizations, we assure coupling to only single hyperfine components of the 
A<sup>1</sup>Σ<sup>+</sup> excited potential and the X<sup>1</sup>Σ<sup>+</sup> rovibrational ground state. In this way an ideal three level system is established, even if the hyperfine structure is not resolved. We demonstrate this pathway with <sup>6</sup>Li<sup>40</sup>K molecules, and discuss its application to other important molecular species.
